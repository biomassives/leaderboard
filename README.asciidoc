= Meteor Leaderboard with CoffeeScript, Less and Bootstrap

A port of the http://meteor.com/[Meteor] framework's
http://meteor.com/examples/leaderboard[Leaderboard example] rewritten
using http://coffeescript.org/[CoffeeScript],
http://lesscss.org/[Less] and Twitter
http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/[Bootstrap].

This port has been enhanced with Bootstrap styling, a drop-down menu
and tooltips. You can also add and delete players, reset the data and
sort players by name and score.  The changes to the original example
reflect these enhancements.  I've made use of the jQuery `$.extend()`
API to soak up repetitive template property assignments.

The only tricky bit was injecting the Bootstrap tooltips into the DOM
after template (re)rendering. This is done with the
`Template.player.render_tooltips` method which is invoked each time
the 'player' template is rendered.  Tooltip injection is defered until
the template has been rendered using the `Meteor.defer` method (see
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10109788/callback-after-the-dom-was-updated-in-meteor-js[this
stackoverflow discussion]).

NOTE: The tooltip workaround works fine with Chrome 18 but still
leaves orphaned tooltips after player deletion on Firefox 11 and IE9.
